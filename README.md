# I'm MikeeUSA (2, because 2 accounts are better than one), and I'm here to say the following:

I love everyone equally. I know that I've had different views in the past, and that I've said some pretty [mean](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/am6xhj/host_agrees_to_dmca_takedown_of_gpld_work_after/efmf7w0/) things in the past (also admitted to being a [pedophile](http://web.archive.org/web/20190202215646/https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/am6xhj/host_agrees_to_dmca_takedown_of_gpld_work_after/efm2bd5/), but I hope to grow past that and be your friend. You can always chat with me by opening up an issue request!
